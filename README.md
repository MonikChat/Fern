# Fern

Fern is a Dataset designed for Ivy, forked from Bo Shao's ChatLearner Project.

## What is Fern

Fern is a dataset composed of four datasets, namely:
 - Reddit Dataset
 - Papaya Dataset
 - Cornell Dataset
 - (TBD) Monika After Story Dataset

And this datasets are further augmented with pre-determined rules and Knowledge bases.

## What needs to be done?

Currently, it's missing the Monika After Story dataset. The following roadmaps are:
 - [ ] hack the Ren'Py AST to extract MAS dialogue.
 - [ ] Make MAS dialogue dataset updates anually (per update).
 - [ ] Extend it more with contributed data.

 ## Contributing

 Currently, custom data will not be accepted per text. This is done using tools written inside `Corpus`.

 However, if you do insist, we strictly follow the Monika After Story Guidelines.
